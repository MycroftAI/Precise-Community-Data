These samples are false activations recorded by mycroft-core with the

In northern portugal it's common to say "รณ XXX" instead of "hey XXX", a 
model i was training learned to always trigger on the "รณ", many of these 
samples reflect that and should be helpful for this kind of wake word. 
Other samples will contain random noises and potentially some dialog from TV
